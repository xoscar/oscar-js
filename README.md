# About this project

This is a compilation of utility libraries and experiments done by its author Oscar R. Reyes. Aimed to learn fancy new tech and share it with the rest of the world.

## Current Libraries

`@oscar-js/explain-my-trace`: NPM package that uses OpenAPI to breakdown a trace, translating the spans and process into human words, provides information about possible bugs/errors in any of the services and valuable insights to understand the nature of the system.
